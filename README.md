### Hi Friends! 👋

My name is Manav Arora and I'm currently a senior studying Computer Engineering and Business at the University of Texas at Austin.

This last summer I interned at Amazon for the Homepage CX team where I built clickable, color-friendly color-swatches to display different color options for a particular product.
