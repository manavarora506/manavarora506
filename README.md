### Hi Friends! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Manav Arora and I'm currently a junior studying Computer Engineering and Business at the University of Texas at Austin.

This last summer I worked at Mavenir and built data analysis tools using MATLAB and also participated in Driving Forward's summer capstone program where I led my team in finding various ways Bitcoin mining companies could actively reduce their energy consumption. 

I will be interning at Amazon this summer as a Software Development Engineer and look forward to working on exciting projects and gaining new experiences.
